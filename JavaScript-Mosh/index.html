    <p><h2>PYTHON</h2>is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. </p>

    <p><h2>What I expect to learn about Javascript</h2>Javascript is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well.
    
    I will expect to learn how to make a calculator in Javascript because I think this will be interesting.</p>
